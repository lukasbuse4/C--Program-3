This assignment focuses on the design, implementation and testing of C++ programs to process data files using arrays and vectors as described below.

For full credit it must be completed no later than **6:00 am on Monday, March 24**. You may turn the program in up to two days late **6:00am on Wednesday, March 26** for -30 points. . No programs will be accepted after that time so do not wait until the last minute to get started. Writing programs usually take longer than you think.

Writing programs usually take longer than you think so get started as soon as you can!
